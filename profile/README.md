**BlockchainUNN** is a student-led developer community at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, focused on building technical talent in Web2 and blockchain technologies. We foster a culture of hands-on learning, collaboration, and innovation through events, workshops, and open-source contribution.

## Developer Bootcamp

The **BlockchainUNN Developer Bootcamp** is our flagship technical training program, held shortly after our **annual conference** â€” a major event that includes talks, workshops, and a hackathon.  

The Bootcamp offers two tracks:

- **Web2 Track:** Frontend, Backend, Git, APIs, Deployment  
- **Web3 Track:** Smart Contracts, Solidity, Blockchain Fundamentals, DApps

Participants engage in intensive training and build capstone projects that reflect their learning and creativity.
